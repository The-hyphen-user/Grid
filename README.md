# Grid
minesweeper
set any size any bomb amount
not importing pics just using numbers
but implementing gui

work done:
stage1 minesweeper 
stage 2 add gui
switching from 2d array code to button object code with inheritance in a 2d button array

things to do:
implement menu gui that ask for size/bomb count
still needs to be optimized in a few way
like generate empty spaces instead of bombs when bombs < 1/2
add win condition
